I am a Front-end Web Developer at [Rated People](https://ratedpeople.com) and my day-to-day job requires me to use tools that I am comfortable with and those serve the purpose. While Rated People does offer any required tools such as [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) licenses for Front-end teams &ndash; I decided to keep using [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) after I joined because of my level of comfortability with it. 

<p class="lead">By the way PHPStorm is a great IDE, nevertheless!</p>

So recently we started to look into [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (vscode) after hearing all the good stuff about it &ndash; especially from our team lead Simon Delaney. Over this past weekend while I was learning some advance stuff about HTML5 Canvas, I decided to give vscode a try.

I started with exploring the welcome screen which gives a fair amount of information on getting started. Especially the interactive playground is one of the best thing to start with. Interface Overview is totaly a next best thing to try. It gives an interactive tour of the editor to get your familiarize with all the important options. 

Keyboard Shortcuts Reference is another handy feature which provides all the shortcuts in PDF format &ndash; ready to print. That is in case of when you want to learn new key bindings to use vscode. If you are coming from SublimeText or Atom, you might find it bit similar. Although you will miss some crucial key bindings. But vscode provides you with best option to go with in such a case. You do not need to learn new shortcuts in vscode but you can import/install shortcuts extension(s) for your existing editor and start using them straightaway. Be it SublimeText, Atom, PHPStorm, Emacs, Eclipse or vim.

Similarly you can also install a theme of your choice and maintain the well formatted code styling while you work on it. In my case it was [Wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbos)'s [Cobalt2 theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2). Since I work with PHP/Symfony therefore I installed another couple of extensions to support code formatting and debugging. In total I had to install 4 extensions to make it all work the same way as it was in SublimeText.

Some of the most amazing things about vscode I found are:

* built-in support for many utility tools and options i.e. finding object definition etc.
* built-in debug console, terminal, version control and more
* lightening fast

I think I will stick to it for now to give SublimeText a break it deserves! Go for it and give it a try by downloading from [Visual Studio website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)!
