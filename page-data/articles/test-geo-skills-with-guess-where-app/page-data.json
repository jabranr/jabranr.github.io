The quiz that used 15 static unmarked map views of famous capitals from around the world - requires you to guess the name of those capitals - ultimately challenging your geographical skills. Despite being maps enthusiast, I could only guess 6 correctly out of 15. I would blame it on playing it straight after waking up in the morning.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I immediately thought, how great it would be to have a live, interactive and dynamic version of it. Well, I also thought why not build it. So here it is at <a href=\"http://jabran.me/guess-where/\">http://jabran.me/guess-where/</a> Go ahead and give it a go!</p>\n<h3>Technical side:</h3>\n<p>The app is based on following technologies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>FontAwesome - for awesome font based icons</li>\n<li>Bootstrap - for overall styling</li>\n<li>JavaScript - for general purpose and interactions</li>\n<li>Google Maps API - for wonderful enriched dynamic maps</li>\n<li>jQuery - for DOM manipulation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To keep the development, deployment and maintenance at ease, I have also incorporated following technologies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Git - for version control</li>\n<li>Github - for convenient collaboration and hosting</li>\n<li>Sass - for customizing the Bootstrap Sass and custom CSS</li>\n<li>Bower - for front-end resource management</li>\n<li>Grunt/NPM - for automatic workflow, builds and deployment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, that looks like a long list and probably an overkill for a one page app but it is pretty much a default setup I would use for any such app.</p>\n<h3>Collaboration:</h3>\n<p>The code of app is open source and <a href=\"https://github.com/jabranr/guess-where/\">available at Github</a> to fork, collaborate or just view under MIT license. You will need followings pre-installed to get going with it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Node</li>\n<li>Sass</li>\n<li>Grunt</li>\n<li>Bower</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fork the repository using <code class=\"language-text\">git clone https://github.com/jabranr/guess-where.git</code>. Once ready, use <code class=\"language-text\">grunt</code> for development workflow and <code class=\"language-text\">grunt build</code> for production build. If you have something to fix or add, then please do not make a production build but open a pull request with only development changes.</p>\n<p>Happy guessing!</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Test your geo skills with Guess Where? app","code":null,"date":"September 07, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/articles/test-geo-skills-with-guess-where-app/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/articles/google-mapmaker-regional-leads/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Google Map Maker Regional Leads","permalink":null}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/articles/ubuntu-dev-workspace-with-terminator-oh-my-zsh-cobalt2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dev workspace setup on Linux (Ubuntu) with Terminator, Oh My ZSH and Cobalt2","permalink":null}}}}}
