AI/ML Engineering & Developer Productivity
• Architected and delivered enterprise-wide AI automation infrastructure for Global Streaming Technology at NBCUniversal/Sky, creating reusable GitHub Actions workflows and AI agent prompts consumed across 50+ repositories, reducing documentation maintenance overhead by 70%

• Engineered interactive AI development workflows enabling developers to trigger AI-assisted code analysis, implementation planning, and automated PR generation through GitHub issue comments, streamlining development cycles for distributed teams

• Designed and implemented AI-powered PR review system using Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 models with custom prompt engineering, providing automated code quality feedback with configurable severity levels and confidence scoring

• Developed comprehensive prompt engineering framework with anti-hallucination patterns, structured output specifications, and guardrails for LLM-generated documentation, ensuring consistency across technical documentation

• Created automated documentation generation pipeline running weekly via GitHub Actions, automatically analysing codebases and generating/updating CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, and GETTING_STARTED.md files with AI agents

DevOps & CI/CD
• Built and maintained multi-organisation deployment pipelines for GraphQL BFF services across NBCUniversal, Sky Global, and Showmax, orchestrating path-to-production workflows across 8+ AWS regions with canary deployments

• Implemented version management automation tooling for monorepo environments, creating shell scripts to track and bump package versions across interdependent services, reducing release coordination time by 60%

• Established GitHub Actions workflow standards with reusable templates for PR reviews, AI agent interactions, and documentation generation, enabling consistent CI/CD practices across the organisation

Technical Leadership & Standards
• Defined organisation-wide AI code review guidelines establishing severity classification (Critical/Warning/Suggestion), confidence scoring methodology, and prompt quality standards for LLM-assisted development

• Standardised technical documentation practices across Global Streaming Technology, creating templates and instruction files for AGENTS.md, terminology, and tone of voice (UK English) used by 100+ developers

• Drove adoption of conventional commits and automated formatting using commitlint, Prettier, and Husky git hooks, improving code review efficiency and commit history quality

Full-Stack Development (Context from Repository)
• Contributed to Next.js 15+ applications using React 19, TypeScript, styled-components, and Apollo Client for GraphQL, serving millions of users across Peacock, NOW TV, and Sky streaming platforms

• Worked with modern tech stack including Node.js 22, TypeScript 5, Playwright for E2E testing, Vitest for unit testing, and AWS Lambda serverless architecture

• Integrated with enterprise tooling including Concourse CI, Artifactory, Vault for secrets management, and Elastic APM for observability

Collaboration & Process Improvement
• Established cross-team AI development standards through comprehensive documentation (AI_PR_GUIDELINES.md, workflow guides) enabling teams to self-serve AI automation capabilities

• Reduced manual code review burden by implementing automated AI-powered reviews with customisable guidelines, allowing senior engineers to focus on architectural decisions

• Championed developer experience improvements through automation, creating helper scripts for common tasks like version bumping, template management, and workflow configuration
