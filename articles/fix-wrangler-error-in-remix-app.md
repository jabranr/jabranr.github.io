If you have a Cloudflare Workers Sites in [Remix](https://remix.run), there are high chance that you may have already or will face the following error on Cloudflare deployment:

```bash
The uploaded script has no registered event handlers. [code: 10068]
```

This error happens with `wrangler` v2 in the Remix app. It happens when any of the packages/dependencies in the Remix app has ESM export format. When it all gets bundled with the `worker` script then `wrangler`'s guessing the worker format does not work quite accurately.

Here is what it says about the guessing worker format in the `wrangler` code in **`node_modules/wrangler/src/entry.ts`**:

```js
/**
 * A function to "guess" the type of worker.
 * We do this by running a lightweight build of the actual script,
 * and looking at the metafile generated by esbuild. If it has a default
 * export (or really, any exports), that means it's a "modules" worker.
 * Else, it's a "service-worker" worker. This seems hacky, but works remarkably
 * well in practice.
 */
export default async function guessWorkerFormat(
...
```

There is already an [issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1668) and a [pull request](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/2396) for this at the wrangler GitHub repository.

Meanwhile, to get our apps working, we can fix the issue using a custom patch. Here are the steps to patch the `wrangler` to make it work as expected in two parts.

### Part 1

> Part 1 is only needed once since it's just the setup.

- Install `patch-package`â€”an extremely useful package to patch broken node modules.

```bash
npm install patch-package
```

- Now go to **`node_modules/wrangler/src/entry.ts`** and replace all entries for:

```js
format: 'esm';
```

with

```js
format: hint === 'service-worker' ? 'cjs' : 'esm';
```

- Now go to **`node_modules/wrangler/wrangler-dist/cli.js`** and repeat the above step and replace all entries for:

```js
format: 'esm';
```

with

```js
format: hint === 'service-worker' ? 'cjs' : 'esm';
```

- Save the files
- Go to the root of the app in the CLI
- Run the following and wait for it to finish creating the patch

```bash
node_modules/.bin/patch-package wrangler
```

This will create a patch file in `patches/warngler+{version}.patch`. It will look something like the following:

### Part 2

- Now add the following script in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "patch-package"
  ...
}
```

This will ensure that `wrangler` is always patched correctly after each `npm install`.
